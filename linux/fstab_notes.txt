Block storage only knows about areas of a volume that have not been written
When an application frees up space or deletes files, the space is not marked as unused.
Filesystm contributers have introduced unmap / trim feature at the file system level that reclaims space.  
These filesystem versions have this feature:

    ext4 (v2.6.36-rc6-35-g7360d17)
    ext3 (v2.6.37-11-g9c52749)
    xfs (v2.6.37-rc4-63-ga46db60)

Already available on ESX 5, now its been introduced on Window 2012 server. 
This would be much useful for many business who are using block level storage like Equallogic , Compellent etc.
On linux its simple enough it mount the filesystem with discard option. 
The Kernel should support TRIM feature and file system must include FITRIM support. This feature was included from Linux kernel 2.6.38.

This feature can be verified on RedHat with 'cat /sys/block//queue/discard_max_bytes'
If the value is zero then the discard option is available.

    [root@server1 ~]# mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
    [root@server1 ~]# mount -o discard /dev/sdb1 /apps

Edit /etc/fstab and add discard option:

    /dev/sdb1 /apps ext4 defaults,discard 0 1

There are two types of "discard" modes, above is how to setup realtime

1)Realtime discard mode
2)Batch mode
