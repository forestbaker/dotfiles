Swap memory is used when the operating system requires more memory than is physically available.  
The kernel swaps out less used pages and gives memory to the current process that needs the memory immediately.
So a page of memory is copied to the preconfigured space on the hard disk. Accessing swapped pages on the hard rive is very slow compared to RAM. 
Swapping pages to disk reduces current application size in memory (RAM).

### How to expand existing swap space ###

Step 1
Check how much disk space is available
    #df -h

Step 2
Create a new partition using fdisk
Mark the new partition as swap by changing toggle id to 82
    #fdisk /dev/cciss/c0d0

Step 3
Run mkswap on the newly created partition
    #mkswap /dev/cciss/c0d0p9
    Setting up swapspace version 1, size = 6004416 kB

Step 4
Run swapon to enable and start using new swap space
    #swapon /dev/cciss/c0d0p9

Step 5
Verify the newly added swap space using below commands
    #cat /proc/swap
or
    #swapon -s

Step 6
Add newly created swap partition to fstab file
    /dev/cciss/c0d0p9 swap swap defaults 0 0


### How to create swap partiton for Logical Volume Manager (LVM) ###
Assuming swap partiton was created on lvm partition:
    # swapoff -v /dev/rootvg/swapvol
    # lvm lvresize /dev/rootvg/swapvol -L +8G (increase from 8 GB to 16 GB)
    # mkswap /dev/rootvg/swapvol
    # swapon -va

### How to remove the swap partition for Logical Volume Manager (LVM) ###
    #swapoff -v /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol01
    #lvremove /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol01
    #remove the swap entry from /etc/fstab
    #/dev/VolGroup00/LogVol01 swap swap defaults 0 0
